Hello! Welcome to my blog. This is the second version of my blog. The first one was hosted on Wordpress.com, but I did not like having no control over the layout and other aspects of the blog. The ever-mysterious Timothy Honeywell both introduced me to Octopress (the blogging framework that I now use) and kindly offered to host me on his Dreamhost account.

Soon, I will copy over my other first post from the Wordpress blog and resume work on my second blog post.
